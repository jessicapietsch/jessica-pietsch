# Writing Style Guide

## 1. Core Philosophy

* Prioritise clarity, accessibility, and inclusivity.
* Assume the reader may not share your background knowledge; define specialised terms.
* Present essential information first, followed by detail.
* Write so the reader expends minimal effort to understand the content.

---

## 2. Voice and Tone

### Web and General-Audience Writing

* Use clear, warm, direct language.
* Use **you**, **we**, **us**, and **our**.
* Use contractions where they improve flow and readability.

### Professional and Formal Documents

* Use precise, concise, outcomes-focused language.
* Use active voice and strong action verbs.
* Minimise “I” unless appropriate for context.
* Emphasise responsibilities, actions, and outcomes.

### General Tone Rules

* Avoid jargon unless it is appropriate for the audience.
* Define acronyms and specialised terms on first use.
* Maintain consistent terminology throughout a document.

---

## 3. Structure and Formatting

* Use clear headings with a consistent hierarchy.

  * `##` for major sections
  * `###` for subsections
* Keep paragraphs short.
* Use bullet points or numbered lists to support scanning.
* Use the serial (Oxford) comma.
* Use bold and italics sparingly.
* Avoid underline styling except for links.

### Links

* Use descriptive link text.
* Ensure the linked phrase meaningfully describes the destination.

## 4. Accessibility and Inclusive Content

* Ensure web content meets accessibility standards (e.g., alt text, captions, transcripts, semantic structure).
* Avoid assuming readers share prior knowledge; offer scaled explanations when concepts are complex.
* Incorporate plain-language explanations for technical or lived-experience terms.
* Avoid metaphors or figurative language when it introduces ambiguity.
* Ensure colour is not the sole carrier of meaning.

---

## 5. Terminology and Consistency

* Maintain a personal glossary for specialised or frequently used terms.
* Use consistent versions of terms (e.g., choose one of “neurodivergent person” or “ND person”).
* Spell out acronyms on first use.
* Provide brief definitions when introducing technical language.

---

## 6. Review and Maintenance Workflow

* Treat this guide as a living document.
* Review annually or after major content projects.
* Note recurring patterns (e.g., sentence length, clarity issues) and add or refine rules accordingly.
* Add guidance for sensitive or complex topics when needed (e.g., lived experience writing, neurodivergence, trauma-aware framing).

---

## 7. Guidelines Specific to Your Roles

### As an Archivist and Librarian

* Ensure descriptions, metadata, and cataloguing language are consistent and accessible.
* Prioritise context and clarity for long-term retrieval.
* Use descriptive metadata labels that support searchability.

### As a Content Creator

* Balance accessibility with archival usefulness.
* Use structured headings, definitions, and clear metadata to ensure your writing can be indexed and retrieved accurately.
* Offer contextual framing for lived-experience language and neurodivergent perspectives.
